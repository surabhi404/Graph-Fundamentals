# Graph-Fundamentals
## Labeled Property Graph vs RDF Graph
  LABELED PROPERTY GRAPH- Object Oriented, vertices/edges as objects, fast traversal and analytics, examples-Gremin,Cypher GSQL
  
  RDF- Fact Oriented, subject-has-property, static,represent knowledge, example-STARQL
  
## Property Graph vs Relational DB or NOSQL
  Property Graph- Entity as Vertices are pre-connected via edges/relationships, No joins for traversal/analysis, 1st class relationships, used for in-depth analysis.
  
  Relational DB or NOSQL- Each entity stored in 1(nosql) or many seperate tables, Joins needed  thus time consuming and expensive, no 1st class relations, used for   transactions   
## Strength of NOSQL-Column, Graph, Key-value, Document
  Column-Eficient column based processing at scale
  
  Graph- 1st class relationships
  
  Key-value- Fast key lookup , stores any type of data
  
  Document- handles structured docs:XML,JSON
## Weaknesses of NOSQL-Column, Graph, Key-value, Document
  Column-Slow update or transaction
  
  Graph- Not real time speed
  
  Key-value- Low level , bare bones
  
  Document- handles specialized docs 
## Graph 1.0, Graph 2.0, Graph 3.0
  Graph1.0- single server,provides native graph storage
  
  Graph2.0-NOSQL, column/key-value type
  
  Graph3.0- Parallel loading,multihop analysis, parallel updates ,native graph storage, scale up andout for speed and size , multi graph for secure collaboration
